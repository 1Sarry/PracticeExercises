#1 What is data model?
  *** It represents data and the relationships of real world entities in a single structure known us Object.
  ***way of organizing data.
  ***OOdata model - commonly used data model.

#2 Components of object-oriented data model:
  Object - Properties - Method - Event - Class

     -Object - the thing we describe. Ex. Shape (Parent Object)
        - Circle, Rectangle, Triangle ( Child Objects )
     -Attributes(radius, length, height, breadth)- properties of the object.

     -Method (GetArea, GetPerimeter) - behaviour of the object - what does it do - it is a function usually restricted to the object.   
    -Events - how does it interact
            - an action  or occurrence that happens with in an object that the object needs to respond.
             ex. click buttons

    - Class: blueprint of an object, it defines all the methods and all the different properties that our objects can have. (just a holder for what our object is going to look like) // Object : instantiated version of a class that has all the data filled in like the values for the properties and methods. 
       eg. House - Blueprint - class
                 - what color the house will be, furnitures,..... Object 

            

*New - Key word .... take a class and turn it into an object.
   

# OOP
the use of objects to represent real world things to our JS.

# Objects in JS: 
    - literal _ object-name = {key1: value1, key2: value2};
      eg. let person = {
               firstName: 'Abebe',
               lastName: 'Kebede',
               someFunction: function () {
                    return this.firstName;
                }
            };
          -person.firstName
          -person['firstName']
          -person. SomeFunction()


Array- Index to retrieve data // object - properties - width, height, color ....



#3 Constructor functions in JavaScript
  - to initialize or create objects 
  - blueprint or template
  - first letter capitalize
  - "new" operator - create new blank object by calling the constructor function
  - "this" (= the new object when created) keyword to point at the newly created object. a substitute for a future/new object that will be created using the constructor function:


#4 Mostly used built-in JavaScript object (string object)  
  - String()
      -Properties
      -methods




#5 JS properties and Methods
 Properties: a way for us to get certain information about an object

 Methods (followed by parenthesis) : allow us to do something to the data inside the object.
 - functions that are part of an object.


  var item = "Drink more water";
  console.log(item.length);
    o/p =  16 (using length property)

  var item = "Drink more water";
  console.log(item.indexOf("w"));  


#Ternary operator
  IF condition is true ? then value X : otherwise value Y.
